# Subdomain Routing Fix Summary

## Problem
When accessing `monitor.yspanel.com`, the application was redirecting to `customer.monitor.yspanel.com` instead of serving the Mission Control dashboard.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the catch-all route in `main.py`. The route logic had a flaw where it wasn't properly detecting when the middleware had set the mission control dashboard flag.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Catch-All Route Logic (`main.py`)
- Added proper `hasattr()` checks for request state attributes
- Improved error handling for missing state attributes
- Added detailed logging for debugging
- Fixed redirect URL construction to handle subdomains properly
- Used proper file handling with context managers and UTF-8 encoding

### 2. Enhanced Subdomain Middleware (`middleware/subdomain_router.py`)
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging subdomain detection
- Improved error handling for missing hostname
- Added visual indicators (✅) for successful subdomain detection
- Enhanced debugging output to track request routing state

### 3. Fixed Configuration Loading (`main.py`)
- Corrected the default fallback value for mission control subdomain from "mission-control" to "monitor" 
- Added configuration logging to verify subdomain settings on startup
- Added expected URL logging for easy verification

### 4. Added Testing and Utilities
- Created `test_subdomain_routing.py` to verify configuration
- Created `restart_server.bat` for easy server restart
- Added comprehensive logging throughout the routing process

## Configuration Verification
The configuration in `config.yaml` is correct:
```yaml
subdomains:
  customer: "customer"           # customer.yspanel.com
  mission_control: "monitor"     # monitor.yspanel.com
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix
- `customer.yspanel.com` → Customer Dashboard
- `monitor.yspanel.com` → Mission Control Dashboard  
- `yspanel.com` → Redirects to `customer.yspanel.com`
- Any other subdomain → Redirects to `customer.yspanel.com`

## Testing
1. Use the `restart_server.bat` script to restart your server
2. Access `https://monitor.yspanel.com` - should now serve Mission Control dashboard
3. Check the server logs for subdomain detection messages
4. Verify no more redirects to `customer.monitor.yspanel.com`

## Key Changes Made
- Fixed state attribute checking in catch-all route
- Improved subdomain detection logging
- Corrected default mission control subdomain value
- Enhanced error handling and debugging
- Added proper file encoding handling
